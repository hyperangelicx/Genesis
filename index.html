	<h2 style="color:pink;">My Origin Story</h2>
<body><p>I am from the state of <strong title="Texas" style="color:brown">Texas.</strong> I am very proud of both my Mexican and American roots. I grew up glued to my computer and playing Sonic the Hedgehog. By the time I got to middle school, I got invested into Japanese <i>anime</i>.</p>

<body><p><h2 style="color:pink;"> My Major </h2></p>
	<h3 style=color:purple;">Digital Media</h3>
<p>I am majoring in Digital Media. The reason why I chose this was because I want to become a Web Developer! I discovered my fascination of front-end web development by playing video games and being world wide web. My dad also suggested that I do "computer stuff". He believes that I do well with this career! ""</p>

<h3 style="color:purple;"> Gaming</h3>
<p> My <emphasis>favorite</emphasis> franchise as of late, is the Japanase mobile game, Disney's <i>Twisted Wonderland.</i> In the game there are seven dorms that are inspired by the Disney villains. The dorm <b>Ignihyde</b> specializes in technology and mechanics. The dorm's housewarden, Idia Shroud, is a prodigy in computing and machinery. He is also a huge nerd like me. Like my father, Idia and other characters inspired me to pursue Digital Media. <br></p>
